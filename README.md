# Who opts for open peer review?

Research Questions: 

1. What are the characteristics of the papers where the authors opted in to open peer review?

2. Does opting in to open peer review predict research quality via citations and retractions?

XML data downloaded from [PLOS](https://plos.org/resource/open-peer-review/). Before publication, authors can opt in to have the peer review published alongside their paper, providing the binary outcome of opting in to open peer review (yes/no).

The _R_ files are in order of execution with a prefix of:

* 0_ read in the XML files and exclude papers that were not peer reviewed
* 1_ process the authors' countries and papers' topics
* 2_ run the statistical models
* 99_ other files, including some functions

The subfolders are:

* `R` for R functions.
* `figures` for figures.
* `checks` for random checks of the data.
* `data` data in _R_ format.
